      p Dalyan is a small town on the South West coast of Turkey, and was originally well known in the area as a fishing village. Dalyan is situated along the broad sweet delta that leads to the famous Iztuzu beach, where the protected Caretta Caretta, or loggerhead Turtle, lay their eggs during the summer months.
      p During the late 80's Dalyan drew international attention with the help of environmentalist movements. These movements campaigned to get Iztuzu beach protected as the Caretta Caretta was becoming close to extinction. The campaign was a success and today the whole area of Iztuzu beach and Dalyan are classified as an environmental protected area. This truly is a place of natural beauty.
