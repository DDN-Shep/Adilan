      p Welcome to Adilan Villas &amp; Apartments, we have been open since 1997. Over that time we have been perfecting our accommodation and services, so if your looking for a great holiday in a warm, sunny, beautiful and friendly location then look no further. Here at Adilhan Villas we offer spacious, clean, friendly and inviting accommodation. We are surrounded by mountain views and orange groves. All nearby to the naturally stunning Turkish Town of Dalyan which has been conserved as a place of natural beauty. Adilan Villas is just a 20 minute drive from Dalaman Airport - one of Turkey's largest international airports. We are extremely easy to get to - airport transfers can be easily arranged so no car is required. There is lots to see and do - visits to the dramatic ruins of Ancient Kaunos are a must and are just across the river from us. Dalyan centre is just a 15 minute walk away where there are some fine restaurants with friendly staff and great food.
